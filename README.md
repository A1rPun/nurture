[Yet another programming chrestomathy](http://www.rosettacode.org)
In every directory there is a README with a quick how to compile & run your program and a bare minimum "hello world" example.

**Todo**
- discover inheritance in every language
- more syntax definitions in every language
- how to package in every language
- how to debug
- link to [learnxinyminutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)

**These [languages](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Programming_languages) are likely to get explored**
- AWK
- Ada
- Clojure
- Crystal
- Dart
- Groovy
- Julia
- ML
- Octave
- Scala
- Scheme

**These languages will (probably) not be explored in this repo**
- COBOL
- Forth
- Fortran
- Objective-C
- Tcl

### Fibonacci sequence

**Test**
```
fib(N)
```
- `N = 0` should return 0
- `N = 5` should return 5
- `N = 78` is the last safe integer in JavaScript
- `N = 92` is the last safe 64bit integer
- `N = 1476` is the last representable integer in JavaScript, PHP & R
- `N = 1000000` should not error
