[Yet another programming chrestomathy](http://www.rosettacode.org)
In every directory there is a README with a quick how to compile & run your program and a bare minimum "hello world" example.

**Todo**
- discover inheritance in every language
- more syntax definitions in every language
- how to package in every language
- how to debug (in VSCode preferably)

**Languages**
- pascallike: turbopascal, delphi
- javalike: clojure, scala, groovy
- others: haskell

### Fibonacci sequence

**Test**
```
fib(N)
```
- `N = 0` should return 0
- `N = 5` should return 5
- `N = 78` is the last safe integer in JavaScript
- `N = 92` is the last safe 64bit integer
- `N = 1476` is the last representable integer in JavaScript & PHP
- `N = 1000000` shouldn't take longer than a couple seconds
