[Yet another programming chrestomathy](http://www.rosettacode.org)
In every directory there is a README with a quick how to compile & run your program and a bare minimum "hello world" example.


### Fibonacci sequence

**Test**
- `fib(0)` should return 0
- `fib(5)` should return 5
- `fib(93)` goes over the max value of an Int64
- `fib(1000000)` shouldn't take longer than 10 seconds

**Todo**
- discover inheritance in every language
- more syntax definitions in every language
- how to package in every language
- how to debug (in VSCode preferably)

**Languages**
- pascallike: turbopascal, delphi
- javalike: clojure, scala, groovy
- others: haskell
